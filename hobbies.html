    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      From an early age, I was, and still am, a bit of an outdoorsman.
      Every now and then I go fishing with Dad, and help him with his horse
      at a friends' farm. Otherwise, I like to game and draw in my free time.
      I stick to playing single-player games due to not having as much time on
      my hands as before. I like many different genres of games and I'm willing
      to try just about any kind.
    </p>

      When I'm drawing, I usually draw portraits
      from references I find using Pinterest. Lately, I've been getting into
      figure drawing to get out of my comfort zone. Art also gives me another
      way to unwind after doing schoolwork.
