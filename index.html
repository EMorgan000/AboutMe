    <p>
      My name is Eric Morgan and this is my second semester here at OTC.
      I'm originally from Cape Girardeau,MO, where I grew up in the bootheel.
      Cape Girardeau is located right on top of the Mississippi River and would
      flood pretty frequently in spring and sometimes summer. It was a nice
      little place to live, but it's very small compared to Springfield and
      you're more likely to get attacked by mosquitoes.

      Before I enrolled in college here, I attended high school at Kickapoo
      where I marched in the Golden Arrow Band for all four years. We competed
      at places like Ozark, Broken Arrow, Tulsa, and finally St. Louis at
      the end of the season. At St. Louis, we competed at a massive stadium
      called the dome. Though it was fun to compete and hang out with my
      friends, but my interest for computer science took over, which got me here.
